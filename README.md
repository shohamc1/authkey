# authkey
A simple program that generates a random array of characters and converts into a string, takes an input from the user and then check whether the user's guess is correct or wrong.
authkey-dev.cpp is a developer version of the game that prints the generated code!\
authkey.exe is the binary version of the game that you can download straight away and start cracking! It might require an additional C++ installation in some Windows machines.
