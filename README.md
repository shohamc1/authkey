# authkey
A simple program that generates a random array of characters and converts into a string, takes an input from the user and then check whether the user's guess is correct or wrong.  The program has a bug in which the input given is correct but still shows it as wrong.  For now, the program prints out the generated key and the wrong character, but this is only for dev purposes and will be removed in the final release!
